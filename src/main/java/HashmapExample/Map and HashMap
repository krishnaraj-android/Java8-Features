// Map is the interface (general concept)
Map<String, Integer> myMap;

// HashMap is a specific implementation <--given by class hashmap
myMap = new HashMap<>();

// You can now use myMap to store and access data
myMap.put("apple", 1);
int count = myMap.get("apple");

In this code:

    We declare a variable myMap of type Map<String, Integer>. This means myMap can hold any object that implements the Map interface.

    We then create a HashMap object and assign it to myMap. Now myMap is a specific HashMap that follows the Map interface rules.

In summary:

    Map is the blueprint (interface).
    HashMap is a specific object built according to that blueprint (implementation).
